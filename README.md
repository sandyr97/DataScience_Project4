Major Leagues: use regression models to determine the scores for each team
Steps:
1.	Load data into dataframe <br />
a.	MLB <br />
b.	MLB latest <br />
2.	Clean data <br />
a.	Check for NAN values <br />
3.	Feature Engineering <br />
a.	Create avg home scores for each team <br />
b.	Create avg away scores for each team <br />
4.	Linear Regression
5.	Gradient Boosting
6.	Conclusions 
I used linear regression and gradient boosting to predict the average score for a home game
and away game for each team. I found each team's average home and away scores and plotted them.
I then used regression and gradient boosting to create the line of best fit for this plot. Both
types of regression prove that a team scores better when they play at home rather than when they play away.
